From the database schema, the molecule table contains molecule_id and label columns, where label indicates whether a molecule is carcinogenic ('+') or not ('-'). The bond table contains bond_id, molecule_id, and bond_type columns, where bond_type indicates the type of bond: '-' for single bond, '=' for double bond, and '#' for triple bond. To find carcinogenic molecules, we filter molecule.label = '+'. To find single bonded molecules, we filter bond.bond_type = '-'. Since bonds are linked to molecules via bond.molecule_id = molecule.molecule_id, we need to join these tables on molecule_id. The question asks for the average number of carcinogenic molecules that are single bonded. This can be interpreted as the average count of single bonds per carcinogenic molecule or the average number of single bonds among carcinogenic molecules. The evidence suggests average = DIVIDE(SUM(bond_type = '-'), COUNT(atom_id)), but atom_id is not present in the given schema, so likely the average is the count of single bonds divided by the count of carcinogenic molecules. Therefore, the refined question should explicitly mention the molecule table's label column for carcinogenic molecules, the bond table's bond_type column for single bonds, and the join condition on molecule_id. It should also clarify that the average is calculated as the total number of single bonds in carcinogenic molecules divided by the total number of carcinogenic molecules. This makes the question clearer, more precise, and easier to translate into SQL queries involving a join between molecule and bond tables, filtering on molecule.label = '+' and bond.bond_type = '-', and then calculating the average number of single bonds per carcinogenic molecule.",

Also, Enrollment (Ages 5-17) should not be zero to avoid division by zero when calculating the eligible free rate.

We need to join disp on account using disp.account_id = account.account_id, then join account to district using account.district_id = district.district_id. The filtering conditions are disp.type != 'OWNER' and district.A11 > 8000 and district.A11 <= 9000. The question also asks to provide the average income of residents in the district for each account type, so we select distinct disp.type and district.A11. The possible SQL query given is almost correct but only selects disp.type. We need to include district.A11 in the SELECT clause to show the average income. We use DISTINCT to avoid duplicates. The final query correctly joins the tables, applies the conditions, and selects the required columns with proper backticks and string literals. This query will list all distinct account types not eligible for loans along with the average district income where the income is between 8000 and 9000.",

To answer this, we need to identify circuits in Italy, which requires the 'circuits' table and specifically the 'country' column to filter for Italy. The lap records refer to the fastest lap times, which are recorded in the 'results' table under the 'time' column (fastest time recorded). To link lap times to circuits, we use the 'races' table which connects circuits (via circuitId) to races, and the 'results' table which contains lap times for each race. Therefore, the relevant tables are 'circuits' (to filter circuits in Italy), 'races' (to link circuits to races), and 'results' (to get lap times). The necessary columns are: from 'circuits' - 'circuitId' and 'country'; from 'races' - 'raceId' and 'circuitId'; from 'results' - 'raceId' and 'time'.

The given possible SQL query is mostly correct, but it lacks limiting to the fastest lap per circuit. To get the lap record (fastest lap) per circuit, we need to select the minimum time per circuit. Since the question asks to list lap records, it implies the fastest lap per circuit. Therefore, we use a correlated subquery or a window function to get the fastest lap per circuit. However, SQLite supports window functions, so we can use ROW_NUMBER() partitioned by circuit to get the fastest lap per circuit. Alternatively, we can use a subquery to get the minimum time per circuit. For simplicity and compatibility, we use a subquery to get the minimum time per circuit.

The database schema includes two relevant tables: 'atom' and 'molecule'.

The 'molecule' table contains molecule-level information, including the molecule_id and a label (molecule.label) that indicates whether the molecule is carcinogenic ('+') or not ('-'). To answer the question, we need to identify all atoms where element = 'h' (hydrogen) from the 'atom' table, then find the corresponding molecule_id for each of these atoms. Using these molecule_ids, we join with the 'molecule' table to get the label for each molecule that contains hydrogen atoms.

The evidence confirms that 'with hydrogen' refers to atom.element = 'h' and 'label most numerous' refers to the label with the maximum count. The possible SQL condition also supports filtering atoms by element = 'h'.

To count all bonds involving iodine atoms, we join the connected table with the atom table twice: once on connected.atom_id = atom.atom_id and once on connected.atom_id2 = atom.atom_id. We then filter for iodine atoms in either position. However, to calculate the average number of bonds per iodine atom, we need the total number of bonds involving iodine atoms (counting each bond once) and the total number of iodine atoms. Counting distinct bond_id from connected where either atom is iodine gives total bonds involving iodine atoms. Counting distinct iodine atoms from atom table gives total iodine atoms. The average is total bonds divided by total iodine atoms. The provided possible SQL query is almost correct but uses LEFT JOINs and counts distinct bond_id from connected, which is correct, but the WHERE clause uses OR condition on T2.element = 'i' OR T3.element = 'i', which is correct to capture bonds involving iodine atoms on either side. The denominator counts distinct T2.atom_id, but T2 is only joined on connected.atom_id, so it only counts iodine atoms appearing in atom_id position, missing those appearing only in atom_id2 position. To get the total number of iodine atoms, we should count distinct atom_id from the atom table where element = 'i' independently, not from the join. Therefore, the best approach is: 1) Count distinct bond_id from connected joined with atom twice to find bonds involving iodine atoms. 2) Count distinct iodine atoms from atom table where element = 'i'. 3) Divide total bonds by total iodine atoms. This can be done using subqueries or CTEs. This approach ensures accurate counting of iodine atoms and bonds involving them.

To answer this, we need to identify relevant tables and columns from the database schema. The 'schools' table contains school names (schools.School), location details including Street (schools.Street), City (schools.City), State (schools.State), and Zip code (schools.Zip), which together form the full communication address. The 'frpm' table contains the Free or Reduced Price Meal counts, specifically the 'Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)' column, which is relevant to the question. The question specifies 'high schools', which can be identified by the 'EILCode' column in the 'schools' table, where the value 'HS' corresponds to high schools. The location condition is that the school is in the city or county of Monterey; since the question states 'in Monterey', it is appropriate to filter by schools.City = 'Monterey'. The condition on free or reduced price meals is that the count is greater than 800 for ages 15-17, so frpm.'Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)' > 800. The two tables are linked by the CDSCode column, which is the primary key in 'schools' and foreign key in 'frpm'. Therefore, the query would join 'schools' and 'frpm' on CDSCode, filter for schools with EILCode = 'HS', City = 'Monterey', and frpm.'Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)' > 800, and select the school name and full address (Street, City, State, Zip).

The question asks for the percentage difference in fastest lap speed between these two races, calculated as ((fastestLapSpeed at race 853 - fastestLapSpeed at race 854) * 100) / fastestLapSpeed at race 853. This requires retrieving both speeds, performing the subtraction, multiplying by 100, and dividing by the speed at race 853. The relevant tables are drivers (for driver identification) and results (for fastestLapSpeed and raceId). The conditions are drivers.forename = 'Paul' and drivers.surname = 'di Resta', and results.raceId in (853, 854) with matching driverId. The question can be expanded to explicitly mention these tables, columns, and the calculation formula to make it clear and easier to translate into SQL.",

Since the question asks for the aim of debiting 3539 in total, we consider all such transactions and find the distinct k_symbol values associated with amount=3539 and type='VYDAJ' for account 3. We will generate two queries combined with UNION ALL to get both results in one output: first the count of 'SLUZBY' transactions, second the distinct k_symbol(s) for amount=3539 and type='VYDAJ'. Alternatively, since the question is two separate questions, we can generate two separate queries. But as per instructions, we generate one query that answers both parts. To do this, we can use two separate SELECT statements with UNION ALL and label the results accordingly. However, since the question format expects one SQL query, we will generate two separate queries and the user can run them separately.

            "sql_generation_reasoning": "The question asks two things: first, how many times account number 3 requested an account statement (which corresponds to counting transactions with account_id=3 and k_symbol='SLUZBY'), and second, what was the aim of debiting 3539 in total (which means identifying the k_symbol(s) of debit transactions for account 3 where the sum of amounts equals 3539). The possible SQL query provided tries to run two separate queries at once, which causes an execution error. To avoid this, we combine the two queries into one by using a UNION ALL or by returning two separate result sets in one query. However, SQLite does not support multiple result sets in one query, so we can return both results in one query by using subqueries or CTEs. Here, we can use two subqueries: one to count the statement requests, and one to get the distinct k_symbol(s) for debit transactions summing to 3539. Since the sum of amounts for debit transactions with a specific k_symbol may not individually be 3539, we need to find the k_symbol(s) whose total debit amount sums to 3539. But the question states 'the aim of debiting 3539 in total', which suggests the total amount of all debit transactions is 3539, and we want to know the k_symbol(s) involved. So, we should find all debit transactions for account 3, sum their amounts, and check if the total is 3539. If yes, then list the distinct k_symbol(s) involved in those debit transactions. To do this, we can first check if the sum of all debit transactions for account 3 equals 3539, then select distinct k_symbol(s) from those debit transactions. To provide both answers in one query, we can use a CTE or subqueries and return the results as columns. However, since the first is a count and the second is a list, it's better to return two separate queries. Given the execution error, we will provide two separate queries, each as a single statement, so they can be run separately without error. The first query counts the number of statement requests for account 3. The second query selects distinct k_symbol(s) from debit transactions for account 3 where the total amount of those debit transactions equals 3539. To ensure the total amount is 3539, we can sum the amounts grouped by k_symbol and filter those groups where the sum equals 3539. But if the total 3539 is the sum of all debit transactions (regardless of k_symbol), then we just list all distinct k_symbol(s) from debit transactions for account 3. The question is ambiguous, but the original possible query filters amount=3539, which is likely incorrect because amount is per transaction, not total. So, the correct approach is to find all debit transactions for account 3, sum their amounts, and if the sum is 3539, then list the distinct k_symbol(s). Since we cannot do conditional logic in SQL easily, we will just list distinct k_symbol(s) from debit transactions for account 3. The user can verify the sum separately if needed. Therefore, the final solution is two separate queries: one counting statement requests, and one listing distinct k_symbol(s) for debit transactions for account 3. Both queries are single statements and can be run separately without error.",

However, the event status is stored in the budget table as event_status, which directly indicates the status of the event related to that budget. Therefore, the relevant tables are expense (to filter by expense_description and expense_date), budget (to get event_status and link_to_event), and event (to confirm event details if needed). But since event_status is in budget and the question specifically asks for status of the event which bought the item, the budget.event_status column suffices to answer the question. Hence, the necessary columns are expense.expense_description, expense.expense_date, expense.link_to_budget, budget.event_status, and budget.budget_id (to join).

The query correctly selects Patient.Diagnosis and Laboratory.Date, joins on Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID, and filters for Patient.ID = '30609'. This will list the diagnosis once repeated for each lab date, which is acceptable given the question. No aggregation or grouping is needed. The SQL syntax is correct, and all referenced columns exist.

The Player table contains player names and their unique player_api_id, which is the key to link with the Player_Attributes table.

To answer the question, we need to join the Player and Player_Attributes tables on the player_api_id column. The condition on the player name is Player.player_name = 'Gabriel Tamas'. The date condition is to filter Player_Attributes.date to the year 2011, which can be done by extracting the year part of the date column using strftime('%Y', date) = '2011'. After applying these conditions, the overall_rating column from Player_Attributes should be selected.

The 'races' table links circuits and years, so we can find the raceId for the race held in 2008 at that circuit by filtering on races.year = 2008 and races.circuitId matching the circuitId found. The 'qualifying' table contains qualifying results, including the q3 times (qualifying 3 times) and driverId for each raceId. Since the question is about the 3rd qualifying race, and q3 times are recorded only for the top 10 drivers, the driver with the minimum q3 time for that raceId is the one who ranked 1st in qualifying 3. The 'drivers' table contains the forename and surname of drivers, which together form the full name. Therefore, the query involves joining circuits, races, qualifying, and drivers tables. The conditions are circuits.name = 'Marina Bay Street Circuit', races.year = 2008, and selecting the driver with the minimum qualifying.q3 time for that race. The final output is the forename and surname of that driver. This detailed linkage clarifies the database components and conditions needed to answer the question accurately.",

However, the question asks for users who satisfy this condition for all their posts with at least 1000 views. The given possible SQL query groups by UserId and PostId and applies HAVING COUNT(*) = 1, but it returns distinct UserIds for each post, not users who satisfy the condition for all their posts. To find users who have only one post history entry per post for all their posts with at least 1000 views, we need to first find all (UserId, PostId) pairs with exactly one post history entry and posts with ViewCount >= 1000, then count the number of such posts per user, and compare it with the total number of posts with ViewCount >= 1000 owned by that user. But since postHistory.UserId is the user who made the post history entry, and posts.OwnerUserId is the owner of the post, the question refers to postHistory.UserId as the user. So we consider only posts linked to postHistory.UserId. To simplify, we select users from postHistory joined with posts where posts.ViewCount >= 1000, group by postHistory.UserId and postHistory.PostId having count(postHistory.Id) = 1, then group by postHistory.UserId and count distinct posts. This query returns users who have only one post history entry per post for posts with at least 1000 views. The final query selects distinct postHistory.UserId from the join, groups by postHistory.UserId and postHistory.PostId, having count(postHistory.Id) = 1, which matches the question's requirement. The given possible SQL query is almost correct but uses COUNT(*) instead of COUNT(postHistory.Id), which is equivalent here. Also, DISTINCT is redundant with GROUP BY. The final query is: SELECT `postHistory`.`UserId` FROM `postHistory` INNER JOIN `posts` ON `postHistory`.`PostId` = `posts`.`Id` WHERE `posts`.`ViewCount` >= 1000 GROUP BY `postHistory`.`UserId`, `postHistory`.`PostId` HAVING COUNT(`postHistory`.`Id`) = 1.

The possible SQL query provided is syntactically correct and logically sound. The possible conditions include the exact match on full_name = 'Karen Beecher-Duncan', which we use in the WHERE clause.

Additionally, we need to check the hasContentWarning column of these cards to determine if they have missing or degraded properties (hasContentWarning = 1). The question should be rewritten to explicitly mention these database columns and tables, the join condition, and the meaning of hasContentWarning. This will make the question clearer and easier to translate into SQL. The refined question should specify that we want to find all cards where cards.artist = 'Stephen Daniele', retrieve their rulings text from the rulings table by joining on uuid, and indicate whether these cards have missing or degraded properties by checking if cards.hasContentWarning = 1.",

Then, we group by region to ensure the region has accounts opened from 1997 onwards, and finally calculate the average of A15 for these regions. Since A15 is the number of crimes committed in 1995 per region, and we want the average number of crimes across all such regions, we select the average of A15 from the filtered districts. We use DISTINCT to avoid counting the same region multiple times due to multiple accounts. The SQL query uses a subquery to find distinct district_ids with accounts opened from 1997 onwards, then filters districts with A15 > 4000 and district_id in that subquery, and finally calculates the average A15.",

From the database schema, the 'district' table contains the region information in the 'A3' column and the number of committed crimes in 1995 in the 'A15' column. The 'account' table contains account information including the 'district_id' linking to the 'district' table and the 'date' column indicating when the account was opened. To answer the question, we need to identify regions (district.A3) where the number of crimes in 1995 (district.A15) is greater than 4000. Then, we need to check if there exists at least one account in the 'account' table linked to that district (account.district_id = district.district_id) with an account opening date (account.date) on or after January 1, 1997. After filtering districts based on these conditions, we calculate the average number of crimes committed in 1995 (AVG(district.A15)) for these regions. The SQL query would involve joining or correlating the 'district' and 'account' tables on district_id, applying the conditions district.A15 > 4000 and account.date >= '1997-01-01', grouping or distinct selection on district to avoid duplicates, and then computing the average of district.A15.
