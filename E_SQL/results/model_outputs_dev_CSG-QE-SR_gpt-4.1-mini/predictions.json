From the database schema, the relevant table is Patient, which contains the columns ID (patient identifier), Diagnosis (disease names), and Admission (indicating whether the patient was admitted to the hospital '+' for inpatient or followed at the outpatient clinic '-' for outpatient). The Diagnosis column in Patient table holds the disease names, so filtering patients with Diagnosis = 'SLE' identifies the target group. The Admission column distinguishes inpatient ('+') and outpatient ('-') status. To calculate the ratio, we need to count the number of patients with Diagnosis = 'SLE' and Admission = '+' (inpatient count), and the number of patients with Diagnosis = 'SLE' and Admission = '-' (outpatient count). The ratio is then the division of inpatient count by outpatient count. This involves filtering the Patient table twice with these conditions and counting IDs, then dividing the two counts. The question can be enriched by explicitly mentioning the Patient table, the Diagnosis and Admission columns, the values '+' and '-' for Admission, and the calculation method for the ratio.

The evidence clarifies that 'atom 19' refers to any atom_id ending with '_19' (like 'TR%_19'). To find the number of connections for atom 19, we need to count how many rows in the connected table have either atom_id or atom_id2 matching any atom_id ending with '_19'.

The frpm table contains the 'County Name' column, 'Free Meal Count (K-12)', and 'Enrollment (K-12)' columns, which are necessary to calculate the percent eligible free meals for K-12 grades. The percent eligible free meals is calculated as (Free Meal Count (K-12) * 100) / Enrollment (K-12), which should be less than 0.18%. To link the schools and frpm tables, the common key is the CDSCode column. The condition for non-chartered schools is schools.Charter = 0, and the county condition is schools.County = 'Los Angeles'. The percent eligible free meals condition is (frpm.Free Meal Count (K-12) * 100 / frpm.Enrollment (K-12)) < 0.18. The query should join schools and frpm on CDSCode, apply these conditions, and count the number of such schools. This detailed understanding allows us to rewrite the question clearly with explicit references to the database tables, columns, and conditions, making it easier to translate into SQL.",

From the database schema and column descriptions, the loan table contains the relevant information: loan.amount (approved loan amount in USD), loan.status (repayment status), and loan.account_id (account identifier). The status 'C' indicates a running contract with no issues. To answer the question, we need to consider all loans with amount less than 100,000 USD (loan.amount < 100000). Among these loans, we identify those with status 'C' (loan.status = 'C'). The percentage is calculated as the count of such loans divided by the total count of loans with amount less than 100,000, multiplied by 100. Since the question asks for the percentage of accounts, and each loan is linked to an account via loan.account_id, we assume each loan corresponds to one account. Therefore, the calculation involves counting loans meeting the conditions. The SQL query would filter loans by amount < 100000, then count how many have status 'C', divide by total loans with amount < 100000, and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

            "sql_generation_reasoning": "The question asks for the code numbers of the top 3 youngest drivers and how many of them are Netherlandic (Dutch). To find the youngest drivers, we need to order the drivers by their date of birth (dob) in descending order (newest dob means youngest). We select the top 3 drivers by dob. Then, from these top 3 youngest drivers, we want to get their code numbers and count how many have nationality 'Dutch' (Netherlandic). The code column may have null or empty values, but we still list them. The nationality column is used to identify Dutch drivers. The SQL query will first select the top 3 youngest drivers ordered by dob descending, then select their code and count how many have nationality 'Dutch'. We can do this in one query by using a CTE or subquery to get the top 3 youngest drivers, then select their codes and count Dutch nationality among them. Since the question asks for both code numbers and count, we can return the code numbers as a list and the count as a separate value. However, since the output format is SQL only, we will return the code numbers and the count in two columns: code and isDutch (1 or 0), then aggregate the count of Dutch drivers. Alternatively, we can return the code numbers in one query and count in another. But here, we will return the code numbers of the top 3 youngest drivers and the count of Dutch drivers among them in one query using UNION ALL. But since the question is about generating a single SQL query, we will return the code numbers of the top 3 youngest drivers and the count of Dutch drivers among them as a single result with two columns: code and nationality, and then count the Dutch nationality in the client side. To keep it simple and aligned with the question, we will return the code numbers of the top 3 youngest drivers and the count of Dutch drivers among them as a single query with two outputs: the code numbers and the count. We can do this by selecting the code numbers and then a separate count query. But since the question is about generating SQL to answer the question, the best approach is to select the code numbers of the top 3 youngest drivers and also count how many of them are Dutch in one query using a subquery. So the final SQL query will select the code numbers of the top 3 youngest drivers and also count the Dutch nationality among them. We will use a CTE to get the top 3 youngest drivers ordered by dob descending, then select their code numbers and count Dutch nationality. This approach is clear and efficient.",

The average ball control score for each player can be calculated by aggregating the ball_control values in Player_Attributes for the respective player. The difference is then computed by subtracting the average ball control score of Aaron Appindangoye from that of Abdou Diallo. The evidence also suggests using conditional aggregation or filtering to compute the averages. Therefore, the refined question should explicitly mention the tables (Player and Player_Attributes), the columns involved (player_name, player_api_id, ball_control), the aggregation (average), and the subtraction operation to find the difference between the two players' average ball control scores.",

The question likely refers to the overall champion's fastest lap number in 2009, which is the champion of the final race or the race with the highest round number in 2009. To be precise, we join results with races on raceId, filter races.year = 2009 and results.position = 1 (champion), then order by races.round descending to get the last race champion's fastest lap number, and limit 1 to get a single value. This approach ensures we get the fastest lap number of the champion in 2009 from the final race of that year.",

The year 2009 corresponds to the 'year' column in the 'races' table. To identify the champion, we need to find the driver who finished in position 1 in the 'results' table for races held in 2009. The 'results' table contains the 'fastestLap' column which indicates the fastest lap number for each driver in a race. The 'results' table is linked to the 'races' table via the 'raceId' column, and the 'races' table contains the 'year' column. The evidence states that only the champion's finish time is shown in the format 'hour:minutes:seconds.millisecond', which can help confirm the champion's result.

To address this, we need to identify relevant tables and columns from the database schema.

The 'frpm' table contains data about free or reduced price meal counts, specifically the 'FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)' column, which indicates the number of free or reduced price meals for ages 5-17.

The 'High Grade' column in the 'frpm' table can be used to filter for high schools; typical high school grades are 9-12 or similar, but since the 'High Grade' column is textual, we can filter for values indicating high school level, or alternatively use the 'EILCode' column in the 'schools' table which has a code 'HS' for High School. To ensure accurate filtering, joining 'schools' and 'frpm' tables on the common 'CDSCode' column is necessary.

To answer this, we need to link transactions with gas stations and filter transactions by date. The transactions_1k table contains transaction details including Date and GasStationID.

The evidence indicates that the yearmonth.Date column uses a 'YYYYMM' format, e.g., '201306' for June 2013, but transactions_1k.Date is in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format. We can extract the year and month from transactions_1k.Date by taking the first 7 characters (e.g., '2013-06') or by using string functions to filter dates between '2013-06-01' and '2013-06-30'. After filtering transactions_1k for June 2013, we join with gasstations on GasStationID to get the Country of each gas station involved in those transactions. Finally, we select distinct countries to avoid duplicates. This involves using the transactions_1k and gasstations tables, filtering transactions_1k.Date for June 2013, joining on GasStationID, and selecting distinct gasstations.Country.

From the database schema, the relevant table is Examination, which contains columns Thrombosis, ANA Pattern, and aCL IgM. The Thrombosis column indicates the degree of thrombosis, with 2 representing 'positive (severe)'. The ANA Pattern column describes the pattern observed in ANA examination, and the question specifies the pattern should be exactly 'S'. The aCL IgM column holds the anti-Cardiolipin antibody (IgM) concentration. The question requires calculating the average aCL IgM value across all patients, then identifying those patients whose aCL IgM is greater than 120% of this average (i.e., 20% higher than average). The count of such patients meeting all these conditions is requested. To answer this, one would first compute AVG(aCL IgM) from the Examination table, then filter patients where Thrombosis = 2, ANA Pattern = 'S', and aCL IgM > 1.2 * AVG(aCL IgM). Finally, count the number of such patients. This involves filtering Examination records on Thrombosis and ANA Pattern, calculating the average aCL IgM, applying the 20% higher condition, and counting the qualifying patients.

From the database schema, customers correspond to the client table, where gender is stored in client.gender and birth date in client.birth_date. The location information is stored in the district table, with district names in district.A2. The client table has a district_id foreign key referencing district.district_id, linking clients to their district. The account table contains accounts opened, with account.account_id and account.district_id referencing district.district_id. To find female clients born before 1950 who stayed in Sokolov and have accounts opened, we need to join client, account, and district tables. The join between client and account can be done via disp table, which links clients and accounts through disp.client_id and disp.account_id. Alternatively, since account has district_id and client has district_id, but no direct link between client and account, disp table is necessary to link client and account. The conditions to apply are client.gender = 'F', client.birth_date < '1950-01-01', and district.A2 = 'Sokolov'. The district table should be joined twice: once to link client.district_id to district.district_id to get the client's district name, and once to link account.district_id to district.district_id to get the account's district. However, the question focuses on customers who stayed in Sokolov, so the district condition applies to client.district_id linked to district.A2 = 'Sokolov'. The question asks for the count of such female clients with accounts opened. Therefore, the query should join client, disp, account, and district tables, apply the conditions on client.gender, client.birth_date, and district.A2, and count distinct client_id or account_id.

To answer this, we need to identify the relevant tables and columns. The 'qualifying' table contains qualifying session data, including the times for q1, q2, and q3 qualifying rounds, with q3 representing the third qualifying session.

To address this, we need to link the users, posts, and postHistory tables. The 'user' refers to the UserId in the postHistory table, which identifies the user who made the post history entry. The 'post' refers to the PostId in the postHistory table. To find users with only one post history per post, we need to group postHistory entries by UserId and PostId and count the number of post history entries per post per user, filtering for counts equal to one. The 'having at least 1000 views' condition relates to the posts table, specifically the ViewCount column, which indicates the number of views a post has. Since postHistory.PostId references posts.Id, we can join postHistory and posts on PostId = Id to access the ViewCount. We then filter posts with ViewCount >= 1000. Finally, we want to find users who meet both conditions: for each post they have only one post history entry, and the post has at least 1000 views. The result should list the UserIds of such users. This involves joining postHistory and posts tables, applying the ViewCount condition, grouping by UserId and PostId, filtering groups with count(postHistory.Id) = 1, and then selecting distinct UserIds. This refined question explicitly mentions the relevant tables (postHistory, posts), columns (postHistory.UserId, postHistory.PostId, posts.ViewCount), and the conditions (ViewCount >= 1000, count of postHistory per post per user = 1), making it clearer and easier to translate into SQL queries.",

Additionally, we filter posts with ViewCount >= 1000. Finally, we select distinct UserIds from these filtered groups.

Since the yearmonth table has consumption data per customer per month (Date), we should consider if the question implies any month or overall consumption. The question likely refers to any consumption record above 46.73 for a LAM customer. The calculation is (number of LAM customers with consumption > 46.73) divided by (total number of LAM customers) times 100. This requires joining customers and yearmonth tables on CustomerID, filtering customers by Segment = 'LAM', and checking consumption values.
